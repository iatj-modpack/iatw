Progressions works a little different from Vanilla.

Instead of just punching trees your first day, you need to punch rocks too.
You need to obtain flint from rocks scattered across the overworld to craft the first tier of tools, flint.

;;;;;

Afterward, you may want to head to the mines, but instead of looking for just the surface stone, you'll need to dig deeper and dig up some copper and maybe grab some coal.

After you head back to the surface and start smelting, you may notice you're getting copper *nuggets*, these can be crafted into copper ingots.
