Normally you would probably be able to get to the dragon with iron or even stone tools, not here.

To craft Eyes of Ender, you'll need End Sludge. You will learn how to craft this item in due time, but don't think it'll be a cakewalk, you'll need to kill 2 withers.

;;;;;

Putting this item in a crafting table with 4 other pearls will get you 4 Eyes of Ender, however, do be cautious, holding the sludge for extended periods of time may make it angry.
