Tool progression requires you to use your ingots to craft plates, so instead of using ingots to make that beautiful pickaxe, you'll need to craft 3 plates.

Every crafting recipe that would normally require ingots, excluding copper now requires plates, and that includes Netherite upgrades.

So go on, get to mining, this is **__Mine__**craft after all!

;;;;;

Remember the **__craft__** aspect as well, don't forget to build a comfortable home for yourself, can't live in the side of a mountain forever, unless that's your thing.
